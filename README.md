# kiwicom-cypress-cucumber

1. This is my first project written in Cypress+Cucumber immediately after completing a course on Udemy
2. Several scenarios related to logging into the "kiwi.com" application are being tested (which I have been using frequently lately to find a flight at a good price for my vacation in Greece :))
2. The main goal was for all scenarios to pass without error with a fairly loose approach to the DRY principle
